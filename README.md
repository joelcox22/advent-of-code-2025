# Advent of Code 2025 Solutions

https://adventofcode.com/

Requirements:
[install deno](https://docs.deno.com/runtime/getting_started/installation/)

Solutions for part 1 and 2 are saved to separate files for simplicity. Most of
them will probably have most code duplicated.

To run solutions against sample inputs (`sample.txt`):

- cd to folder for the relevant day
- run `./part1.ts` or `./part2.ts`

To run against real inputs:

- cd to folder for the relevant day
- save your puzzle input to `input.txt`
- run `./part1.ts input.txt` or `./part2.ts input.txt`

The solutions here are not intended to be examples of good code, it's just what
worked first for me to get my answers.
